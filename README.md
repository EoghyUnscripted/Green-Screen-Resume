# Interactive Green-Screen-Like Resume

## Overview

I built this core app as a mini interactive resume. While it might not really encapsulate my skills as a fully fleshed out project, it does show that I have skills using Python and object-oriented programming.

### Version: 1

- This version is as simple as it gets and uses some hard-coded items
  - i.e. `get_function()` uses a list that is hard-coded
- Each section has a function to determine how to print data to the screen

### Version: 2

- The next version will have more dynamic coding to replace some hard-coded items
- I will be working on implementing more reusable functions to clean up the code
  - i.e. Combining the `education` and `experience` functions

## Setup

1. Windows Users: Install Python 3

### Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. In your terminal, navigate to the directory with the cloned using the appropriate commands for your OS
3. Run the main python file `resume.py`

### Comments

- The program uses a JSON file for the data, so the structure ***must*** be maintained when modifying the data within the nested lists
